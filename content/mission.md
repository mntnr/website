So you've started an open source project. Got your own repos on github. Great. You're part of the best solution to modern coding problems.

But then your project gets 1000 stars. You start having issues every day. And now, you're even tasked with maintaining an open source codebase from someone who left your company.

This is the invisible problem with Open Source projects.  It's really easy to start. And when your project becomes popular, it is really, really hard to maintain.

And the toughest part is that there is no quick-fix solution. This is not just a technical problem; it's a social problem. There's not an app out there that can you can use to figure out how to scale your work, or how to outsource maintenance.


**That's where we come in.**

First, we can do [one-off audits](https://plasso.com/s/KHnLKOSeK1) of repositories or organizations. We have an internal checklist that we'll run through — is the README standardized, is there a Contributing document, a License, and so on.

**[We'll check your README for free.](https://plasso.com/s/KHnLKOSeK1)** Simply mail your repository name to [richard+readme@maintainer.io](mailto:richard+readme@maintainer.io).

Our other service is [a retainer](https://plasso.com/s/RMPMGYmBER). We'll do the audit above, but also stick around to help out with actively maintaining the repository.
